# [Templato](https://ajkueterman.com/templato-android/)

Templato is a simple Android template/example app.  It's mostly meant to be used as a reference for building out a very simple Android client.

## What's in Templato?

Templato consists of an `App` class, a `MainActivity` with an associated Android `ViewModel`, and three Fragments - one with a `RecyclerView` and Adapter.

The app uses the Android Lifecycle-Aware [`ViewModel`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel.html) and [`LiveData`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata.html) to enable the Views in your Fragments and Activities to react to changes in your data automatically.

## Maintenance

My goal is to use Templato to keep up to speed with the latest Android API's that impact a basic app like this.  To that end, I'll be attempting to keep this app as up to date as possible as changes are announced.  

Hopefully you'll never see a warning in this project when you download a new version of Android Studio.
